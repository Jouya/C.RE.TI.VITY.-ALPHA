# C.RE.TI.VITY.-ALPHA
C.RE.TI.VITY. ALPHA is a program that uses audio data that is produced by the user to display different visuals at different states/audio levels.

NOTE: For maximum quality, please run C.RE.TI.VITY. ALPHA in a quiet environment and make continuous noises rather short ones.
red = quiet
yellow = some noise
green = relatively loud

This project is meaningful to me because I have always wanted to incorporate sound in some shape or form into one of my coding projects. I have always wanted to create my own custom volume meter, and this project definitely gave me a snippet of how that might look like. There is also a gaming element within this project, which as a gamer myself, I enjoy a bit :)

This project was really challenging because I had no idea where and how to start. I had to learn about different ways to capture audio using Java, and tried different approaches by different people. I then how to manipulate and build upon an existing project to suite my own needs. In order to do that, I had to learn how the existing code operated and I had to learn about classes such AudioFormats, TargetDataLine, JFrame, and much more. There were definitely some points where I thought that I had hit a dead-end, however, my sheer curiosity and desire to accomplish what I had set my mind to, pushed me forward. The next steps for this project would be optimization with a little bit enhancements in the visuals department. 

I would say the concept behind this project is creative. However, the project itself is certainly not as it operating solely on the instructions that I have given it. Creativity shouldnâ€™t boil down to a few if-statements and Booleans.
